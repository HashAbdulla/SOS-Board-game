# SOS-Board-game
## By Hashim Abdulla
CS449 Software engineering project where I’ll build an SOS board game with both human and computer players. I’ll make sure to develop it incrementally through sprints, applying software engineering practices (requirements, design, coding, testing, refactoring, and documentation).
